# Top Thesis Tips

A short, incomplete list of hints to help you write your Bachelor's/Master's thesis at MCC.

- it's called "Bachelor's Thesis" or "Master's Thesis" (not "Masters Thesis", "Master Thesis", "Masterthesis", etc.)
- use the [Oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/)
- use American spelling (e.g. "analyze" instead of "analyse")
- use our [LaTeX template](https://github.com/pfandzelter/MT-Template) to get up to speed quickly
- avoid weasel words and using too much passive voice (you can use our [proof tool](https://github.com/pfandzelter/proof) to check your text)
- use "we" instead of "I" (weird at first but you'll get used to it)
- read [this post by Prof. Leitner](https://philippleitner.medium.com/some-frequent-writing-tips-i-give-software-engineering-thesis-students-da2acab30381)
